A pannable writing plane for working on massive amounts of prose, organized by column. Navigate with the mouse, keyboard, or via a map.

In a time when memory capacity is growing exponentially, memory storage and retrieval, especially when it comes to prose, still seems quite undeveloped. It makes very little sense, to me, to have a massive hard drive when, in terms of text, actual production might be on the order of kilobytes per year. Depending on how prolific you are as a writer, you may have thousands or tens of thousands of pages in mysteriously named folders on old hard drives (say, since 5th grade). So the problem is one of organization, retreival, and accessibility rather than availability of space. There are various efforts in this regard, including desktop indexing and personal wikis. It might not even be a bad idea to simply print out and keep as a hard copy everything written over the course of a month. 

The textabyss is yet another solution to this problem. It presents a plane that one can append to endlessly with very little overhead. It provides means to navigate and, either at the moment of writing or retrospectively, map out this plane. Ideally, you would be able to scan over the map and easily access writings from last night, a month ago, or even 5 to 10 years earlier. It presents some unique advantages over both indexing and hyperlinked or hierarchical organizing.
