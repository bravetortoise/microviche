# textabyss
A pannable, zoomable 2D text plane for VIM for working on massive amounts of prose, organized by column. Navigate with the mouse, keyboard, or via a map. Also hosted at [vim.org](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4835).

###Intro

In a time when memory capacity is growing exponentially, memory organization, especially when it comes to prose, seems quite underdeveloped. Text production may be on the order of kilobytes per year yet still seem unmanageable. Depending on how prolific you are, you may have hundreds or thousands of pages in mysteriously named folders on old hard drives. There are various efforts in this regard, including desktop indexing and personal wikis. It might not even be a bad idea to simply print out and keep as a hard copy everything written over the course of a month. 

The textabyss is yet another solution to this problem. It presents a plane that one can append to endlessly with very little overhead. It provides means to navigate and, either at the moment of writing or retrospectively, map out this plane. Ideally, you would be able to scan over the map and easily access writings from last night, a month ago, or even 5 to 10 years earlier. It presents some unique advantages over both indexing and hyperlinked or hierarchical organizing.

###Installation

Install by downloading the single file nav.vim above and sourcing it in vim via `:source nav.vim`.

Once sourced, press **F10** to begin. Help and a changelog are baked in (usually by pressing **F1**).

The latest version may be somewhat unstable. Earlier releases can be found in the above vim.org webpage or under the releases tab.
